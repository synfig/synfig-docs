## Synfig 1.4.3 Release Notes

Synfig Studio 1.4.3 introduces major performance optimizations for Windows users and important bugfixes for all platforms. Please read the details below.

### Optimizations for Windows version
- We have removed many bottlenecks in Synfig's code, related with redundant calls of "getenv" function. This resulted in great performance improvement of Windows version ([#2826](https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/2826)). This fix also gives slight speed boost for MacOS, while Linux users will not see any significant difference.
- Windows version now shipped with embedded Python version 3.8.10, which results in smaller size of distributive and faster installation ([#67](https://github.com/morevnaproject/morevna-builds/pull/67)).

### Critical fixes
- Connecting bone parameter to exported value does not results in corrupted file anymore ([#2433](https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/2433)).
- Fixed issue with autosave not working when interval is set to 15 seconds ([#2647](https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/2647)).
- Fixed "Link To Spline" action not shown in menu when trying to connect vertex to spline ([#2344](https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/2344)).
- Fixed Appimage compatibility with recent Linux distributions ([#33](https://github.com/morevnaproject/morevna-builds/pull/33)).
- Fixed issue with Text Tool not working on MacOS because of missing "fonts.conf" file ([#2380](https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/2380)).

### Improvements
- Ask if user wants to link transformation instead of origin ([#2468](https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/2468)).
- The "Link width and height" option is enabled by default in Render Settings ([#2351](https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/2351)).

### Export

- Fixed exporting issue which was resulting in exported video trimmed to audio length ([#2477](https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/2477)).
- Fixed "magick++" render module not available in in Linux AppImage ([#2320](https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/2320)).
- Fixed crash when rendering to gif target ([#2389](https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/2389)).
