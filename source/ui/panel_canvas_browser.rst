present in the currently selected document:

`Exporting <Export>`__ a canvas parameter of a `Group <Group>`__ Layer
will cause the canvas to be added to the ``Canvas Browser`` dialog.
Double-clicking on a sub-canvas in the dialog will open a new Work Area
window allowing you to work on the sub-canvas separately.
