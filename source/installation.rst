For more information see `this forum thread <https://discourse.appimage.org/t/how-to-make-an-appimage-executable/80>`__. 


MacOS / OSX
=============

#. Download the .dmg file.
#. Open downloaded dmg file.
#. Drag the Synfig Studio icon file into your Applications directory. Wait for the copy process to be completed.
#. Run Synfig Studio from your Applications directory.

If you get an error message like "can't be opened because it comes from a non identified developer", then do the following:

#. Locate the Synfig Studio app in Finder (don’t use Launchpad to do this - Launchpad doesn't allow you to access the shortcut menu)
#. Control-click the app icon, choose "Open" from the shortcut menu.
#. Click Open.

The app is saved as an exception to your security settings, and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it just as you can any registered app.

.. note::
    You can also grant an exception for a blocked app by clicking the “Open Anyway” button in the General pane of Security & Privacy preferences. This button is available for about an hour after you try to open the app. To open this pane, choose Apple menu > System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, then click General.
