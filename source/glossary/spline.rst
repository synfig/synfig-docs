| Splines are vector shapes made up of `Bezier
  curves <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve>`__ joined
  together by
  `vertexes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_%28geometry%29>`__.
| Splines are the most commonly used objects in any normal animation
  done with Synfig, and can be made using the `Spline
  Tool <Spline_Tool>`__ and many other Tools.

   A spline of “Spline”. Can see orange vertex and yellow tangent
   `handles <Handle>`__

On the `WorkArea <WorkArea>`__ you can manipulate the ``Spline`` shape
by both handles (vertex or tangent) and directly from the spline segment
(the curve).
