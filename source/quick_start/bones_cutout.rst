   Basic Bone Tutorial

Introduction  
------------------

In this tutorial we are going to rig an arm with
fixed joints using the `Skeleton Layer <Skeleton_Layer>`__ and three
bones. The arm consists of three parts: the **upperArm**, the
**lowerArm** and the **hand**. (pic.1) Each part is grouped in its own
layer and the three groups are again grouped in a layer that is called
**arm** (pic.2).

Prepare the joints
-------------------
.. figure:: bones_cutout_dat/Bonestut02.png 

   PICTURE 3: Joints

Before we start rigging the arm we have to prepare
it to make sure that the joints properly rotate.

In *picture 1* we can see that the lower side of the upper arm is
straight and does not have an outline, while the upper part of the lower
arm has an outline that is curved. The bottom part of the lower arm does
not have an outline and is also straight. The joint of the hand is also
curved with an outline.

To make sure that the joint parts of the arm rotate correctly, we made
them with the help of a couple of crosshairs
([Doc:Basic\_Bone\_Tutorial#Tip\_for\_making\_a\_crosshair]) (picture
3). In *picture 4* and *picture 5* we can see how the horizontal
crosshair line matches the straight line of the bottom of the upper arm
and at the same time the outline of the circle of the crosshair matches
the top curved outline of the lower arm.

The same principle is applied to the hand and the bottom part of the
lower arm. The crosshairs also mark the centre of the rotation point
that will later be used when placing the bones. Before placing the bones
we can align the `Group Transformation
Widget <Group_Transformation_Widget>`__ (press control and move the left
corner handle of the `Group Transformation
Widget <Group_Transformation_Widget>`__ to move it.) of the **lowerArm**
group and the **hand** group with the crosshairs of the elbow and the
wrist to check if the joints rotate correctly.

| Don’t forget to bring the arm into its original position by pressing
  undo. (Don’t worry if the hand does not rotate with the elbow when you
  check the elbow joint by using the `Group Transformation
  Widget <Group_Transformation_Widget>`__.)

Adding the bones
----------------

.. figure:: bones_cutout_dat/Bonestut13.png
   
   PICTURE 6: Adding bone   

| Now it’s time to add a `Skeleton Layer <Skeleton_Layer>`__ that will
  provide the bones we need to rig the arm.

| Right-click on any layer in the `Layers Panel <Layers_Panel>`__ and
  choose ``New Layer -> Other -> Skeleton``. A new `Skeleton
  Layer <Skeleton_Layer>`__ (pic. 7) will appear in the `Layers
  Panel <Layers_Panel>`__ alongside with a small bone in the canvas
  (pic.6). Put the `Skeleton Layer <Skeleton_Layer>`__ above the **arm**
  group if it is not already there. The green handle of the bone is the
  origin of the bone and is used to move the bone in place and is also
  its centre of rotation. The blue handle is used to rotate the bone.
  The orange handle determines the lenght of the bone is used to stretch
  the bone and its contents. The first bone is the parent bone and
  should be moved toward the shoulder and stretched so that it almost
  reaches the outlines of the first crosshair of the elbow. Right-click
  on any of the handles of the parent bone and select
  ``Create Child Bone``. Move the green origin point of the child bone
  so that it matches the crosshair of the elbow and stretch it until it
  almost reaches the crosshair of the wrist. Right click on any of the
  handles of the child bone and create another child bone. Move the
  green origin point of the second child bone so that it matches the
  crosshair of the wrist (pic.8). Stretch the bone until it reaches the
  end of the fingers.

Attaching the bones
-------------------

.. figure:: bones_cutout_dat/Bonestut12.png

   PICTURE 8: Attaching hand to second child bone
   
Now that the `Skeleton
Layer <Skeleton_Layer>`__ is in place we have to attach the bones to the
parts of the arm.

In the `Layers Panel <Layers_Panel>`__ click on the **upperArm** group,
right-click and ``Select All Child Layers``. Then press ``ctrl|A`` in
the canvas window. With everything in the **upperArm** group
highlighted, ``ctrl``-click on any bone in the canvas window and
right-click on any of the handles of the parent bone and click
``Link to Bone``. The **upperArm** group is now linked to the parent
bone. Go the `Layers Panel <Layers_Panel>`__ again and select the
**lowerArm** group. Right-click and ``Select All Child Layers``. Press
``ctrl|A`` in the canvas window and ``ctrl``-click on one of the bones.
Then right-click on any of the handles of the first child bone and
select ``Link to bone``. The **lowerArm** group is now linked to the
second child bone. In the `Layers Panel <Layers_Panel>`__ select all the
child layers of the **hand** group and press ``ctrl|A`` in the canvas
window. ``ctrl``-click on any bone and then right-click on any of the
handles of the second child bone and select ``Link to bone`` (pic.8).

The hand is now linked to the second child bone and the entire skeleton
is now linked to the arm.

It is worth to note for new users that in case the bone is linked to an
image, selecting all its handles and linking them to the bone could lead
to an initially unpredictable behavior. If we need for example to apply
only a rotation around the pivot point defined by the bone, it is
necessary to select only the green handle that defines its position.
Then use the blue handle of the bone to apply the rotation.

Tip for making a crosshair
--------------------------

| Making a crosshair in Synfig is easy. Draw a circle. Draw the outlines
  of a square and align them with the circle. Draw an X using the
  corners of the square as a reference. Delete the square. Group the
  circle and the X. Rotate 45 degrees using the `Group Transformation
  Widget <Group_Transformation_Widget>`__.

Explanation n°2 additional
==========================

To transform 2 sticks into 1 leg
--------------------------------

**The top stick is a “thigh”, the bottom stick is a calf.**

-  0: 2 identical sticks + a crosshair.

-  1: The 2 sticks touch edge to edge to form a crosshair.

-  2: The 2 sticks without crosshair of flesh color.

-  3: The 2 sticks with crosshair without color.

-  4: This mark must be used.

-  5: To cut the upper limb.

-  6: Like here.

.. figure:: bones_cutout_dat/Crosshair-leg01.png
   :alt: Crosshair-leg01.png


-  7: Then the limb must be merged (full).

-  8: With the cut part.

-  9: Result.

-  10: Same for bottom limb.

.. figure:: bones_cutout_dat/Crosshair-leg02.png
   :alt: Crosshair-leg02.png


-  13: The only part not to be merge is the one where the circle (blue)
   it is the crosshair that should not be touched.

-  15: Then the rotation will be correct.

-  16: To be able to do any rotation.

.. figure:: bones_cutout_dat/Crosshair-leg03.png
   :alt: Crosshair-leg03.png


-  17: Limb of the top.

-  18: Limb of the bottom.

-  21: Limbs in movement (detached).

-  22: Limbs in movement (attached).

-  23: The leg finished with the crosshair.

Important
---------

**The crosshair must stay with our 2 sticks, for the duration of the
limb's creation.**
