    How to Help
########################

Synfig is an open-source software, and “open-source” is all about community contributions! So even a regular (non-developer) user can help a lot! How? Read below.

**1. Help other users**

There are many people who are asking for help at `our forums <https://forums.synfig.org/>`_. If you already know how to solve particular problem - don’t hesitate to lend a hand to them!

**2. Report issues**

Found an issue? Report it to `our issue tracker <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues>`_! Also, we recommend to read `this guide <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html>`_ on how to report bugs effectively.

**3. Help to test development releases**

Give a try to `development releases <https://www.synfig.org/download-development/>`_ and help to identify issues and weak places. The more people will test development release - the better stable one becomes!

**4. Help to test open Pull Requests**

You can help developers by giving your feedback about new improvements, which are proposed to be added into code (Pull Requests or PRs). This will help developers decide which features are ready to be included and allow to spot what should be improved. Check the list of open Pull Requests on `this page <https://github.com/synfig/synfig/pulls>`_ and read :ref:`testing_prs` for details.

**5. Help to translate user interface**

Translation of Synfig's user interface is takes place online `at Transifex platform <https://www.transifex.com/morevnaproject/synfig/>`_. You can help improve ttranslation to your language.
